# Road Map

## Data Set
- Should normalize data once and store at DataBase would be efficient.

## APIs
- Split API path by different purpose (single and multiple records).

## Codes
- Consider to use typescript for Object-Oriented Programming

## Unit-Test
- Add Unit Tests mechanism on this project, currently business logic service the [salary.service.js](./src/services/salary.service.js) including constructor for dependency injection on testing.
